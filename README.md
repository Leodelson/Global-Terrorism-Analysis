# Global Terrorism Analysis

## Problem Statement
Understanding global terrorism trends is crucial for governments, security agencies, and policy experts. Terrorist attacks vary significantly across regions, time periods, attack types, and target locations. Without a clear analytical view, it becomes difficult to identify high-risk areas, emerging threats, evolving attack methods, and the global impact on populations.  
This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of global terrorism patterns, enabling better decision-making, strategy development, and resource allocation for counter-terrorism initiatives.
